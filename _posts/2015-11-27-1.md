title: Cloud Code from parse.com

Today I tried Cloud Code from Parse.  They have done a very good job to deploy
applications on the cloud.  All I had to do is...

0. Create a subdomain for the parse application I wanted to use as backend.  
    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/parse-subdomain.png)


1. Install their command line tool

	```bash
	curl -s https://www.parse.com/downloads/cloud_code/installer.sh | sudo /bin/bash
	```

2. Create a first app

	```bash
	parse new
	Would you like to create a new app, or add Cloud Code to an existing app?
	Type "(n)ew" or "(e)xisting": e
	# Gotcha: On my first attempt I did not read this correctly and chose (n)ew.
 	# This resulted on my code being deployed on a new application, different
	# from the application associated with the subdomain chosen above.
	# A bunch of 'Internal Server Errors' later I found the problem.
	...
	```

3. Create a template app using Express js framework

	```bash
	parse generate
	...
	```
4. Edit the code under ```cloud/app.js```

5. Deploy
	```bash
	parse deploy
	...
	```

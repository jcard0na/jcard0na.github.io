title: Building native particle firmware with SSL
---

I wanted to check out the [new ssl
library](https://github.com/glowfishAPI/httpsclient-particle) for particle.io's
photon. 

Steps to do that:

1. Check [the dependencies](https://github.com/spark/firmware/blob/develop/docs/dependencies.md)
2. Get and build the native firmware
```bash
git clone git@github.com:spark/firmware.git particle-firmware
cd particle-firmware/modules
git checkout develop

# put the photon in DFU mode by by holding down the mode/setup button on the
#device and then tapping on the RESET button once. Release the MODE/setup button
#after you start to see the RGB LED flashing in yellow.

PARTICLE_DEVELOP=1 make clean all PLATFORM=photon -s program-dfu
```

3. Clone the httpsclient in your development folder
```bash
git clone git@github.com:glowfishAPI/httpsclient-particle.git
cd httpclient-particle
cp -r firmware/* ../particle-firmware/user/src/
cd ../particle-firmware/user/src/
cp examples/timeapi-test.cpp .
sed -i -e 's/httpsclient-particle\/httpsclient-particle.h/httpsclient-particle.h/' timeapi-test.cpp
rm -fr examples
rm application.cpp
cd ../../modules
PARTICLE_DEVELOP=1 make PLATFORM=photon -s program-dfu
```

4. Watch your console
```

## Gotchas

If forgot that for each now photon you need to configure your network
credentials using your host. The steps are documented [here](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/)
I could not find how to give it a default network credentials  at compile/flash time.

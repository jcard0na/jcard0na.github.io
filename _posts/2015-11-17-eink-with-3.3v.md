title: E-ink display at 3.3V
---

I've been experimenting with [e-ink segmented
displays](http://www.eink.com/display_products_surf.html) for a new design.  I
could not find good documentation on how the display would behave at voltages
below the recommended minimum of 5V.  The results turn out to be quite good,
with the caveat that you will have to allow for a longer settling time.

In the picture on the left, I turned on the background with 15V.  On the right,
I used 3.3V.  The result is almost identical, except that in the low-voltage
scenario, the display took a few seconds to "darken".

##Pinout
This is the pin out of the breakout board.  Note that I had to cut the
plastic in the connector to make it fit into an 8-pin connector.

1|NC
2|dot1 (top)
3|dot2
4|dot3
5|dot4
6|dot5 (bottom)
7|background
8|reference electrode

To "darken" a segment, set a positive voltage between the corresponding pin
and the reference electrode.  To "clear" a segment, reverse the voltage.

The pattern in the pictures is obtained by setting pin 7 to V+ (3.3 or 15V)
and pin 8 to GND.  It is clear by setting pin 7 to GND and pin 8 to V+.

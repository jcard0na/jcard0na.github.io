I’m an engineer-turned-entrepreneur with an undeniable passion for building
useless things that solve absolutely no problems. While most people strive to
create solutions that change the world, I prefer to invest my time and energy
into inventions no one asked for—like a [solar-powered chess keychain](https://lightnote.cardonabits.com/) or
an [open-source saxophone with mechanical keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quGswQKbFMA).
Some other things I have worked on in the past, are equally useless but have
fancier titles, like [wireless mesh
networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224116334_IEEE_80211s_the_WLAN_mesh_standard)
or [self-organizing mesh access](https://github.com/facebookarchive/fbmeshd).

To my surprise, once built, some of my projects did find an audience.  So I'm
not quite cured from my bias for action.
